Misc-GSoC
=========

Misc code/documentation for work on MLton GSoC-2013

Initally just meant for scratch work and references, but now also a catchall
place for any code not yet merged into my fork of mlton.

Structure:
  simd-code:Code written for/useable in the actual project

  resources:Documentation and code usable as a reference, either
    on simd (implemention,intrinscs etc) or MLton

  misc:A place for quick scratch code etc.

  test:Code written to test some feature, more formal tests are in simd-code

  todo.org:A todo file, both for formal long term project goals as well as 
    short term goals

  notes.org:A file used to easily record any useful information 
 
  design.org:Org source of the design document, can be published in various formats
